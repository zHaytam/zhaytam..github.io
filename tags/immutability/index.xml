      <description>Immutability has been getting popular these last years, especially with the rise of not only functional programming and but also JS frameworks such as React.
It&#39;s an important concept for many reasons, but I won&#39;t get into it in this blog post because it&#39;s not the point. Although I would urge you to either read The Dao of Immutability or watch Jon Skeet&#39;s The changing state of immutability in c# video, which explain it in details.</description>
