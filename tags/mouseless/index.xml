      <description>I was prototyping a 2D Side Scroller game in Unity a week ago and started implementing an Inventory System (Equipments, slots, etcâ€¦).
Unfortunately, Unity didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Context Menu out of the box so I searched a bit and found this, which helped me get an idea of how to implement one as well as make it completely mouseless, since my game was mouseless itself.</description>
