      <description>Health checks are a set of checks (duh) that you perform in order to tell whether an application/service is up, running &amp;amp; healthy or not. It&#39;s usually one or more endpoints that reports the status, the response differs from language/framework to an other.
Health checks are very useful especially when your application depends on other things like a database or even other services.</description>
