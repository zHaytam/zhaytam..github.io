      <description>I was prototyping a 2D Side Scroller game in Unity a week ago and started implementing an Inventory System (Equipments, slots, etc…).
Unfortunately, Unity didn&#39;t have a Context Menu out of the box so I searched a bit and found this, which helped me get an idea of how to implement one as well as make it completley mouseless, since my game was mouseless itself.</description>
