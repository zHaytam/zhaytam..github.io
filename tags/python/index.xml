      <description>I was working on a personal project the other day and I needed to create some images (frames) and save them as a playable GIF. Working in Python, I excepted to find an easy solution fast but oh boy did it take me too long to find it.
Here I am now, creating a blog post to help future people looking to create gifs in Python.</description>

      <description>Implementing your own neural network can be hard, especially if you&#39;re like me, coming from a computer science background, math equations/syntax makes you dizzy and you would understand things better using actual code.
Today I&#39;ll show you how easy it is to implement a flexible neural network and train it using the backpropagation algorithm.</description>
