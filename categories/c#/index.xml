      <description>Yesterday, Prashanth Govindarajan posted an article about DataFrame on the .NET Blog. I got excited and wanted to try the library as soon as I could. In this post, I will explain what the library is intended for and what are my thoughts on it.
The package The DataFrame related classes were introduced in the package Microsoft.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I needed a way to connect to a server using a Socks5 proxy but couldn&#39;t find an up-to-date implementation for .NET Core, so I decided to give it a go myself.
The implementation is pretty straightforward and easy, I got inspired from starksoft-aspen and followed the official RFC.</description>

      <description>Assuming you are familiar with C#;
If I give you a Type and tell you to create an object with it, you would automatically think of Activator.CreateInstance right?
What if I tell you that instanciating a Type using Expression Trees is much faster?
The code for the benchmarks is in this repository.</description>
